## Abstract
This is a paired programming project during our time at Turing School of Software and Design — Module 3 Front End Engineering. This app allows a user to login and view various rental locations around Denver. Upon choosing an Area, the user is shown an overview of all available listings for that given area. Then the user chooses a specific listing to view all of the pertinent details and images for that listing. The user is then able to 'favorite' a listing if they like. This listing is then shown in the button context of the 'View My Favorites' button as a running count of favorited listings. Then the user clicks the 'View My Favorites' button to view a collection of all of their favorites. Favorites can be removed at any time from the relative path of the listing, or from the favorites view.
